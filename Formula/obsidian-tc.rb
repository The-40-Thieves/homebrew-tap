  # Prebuilt Bun standalone binaries, published per-platform on every GitHub release
  # (The-40-Thieves/obsidian-tc's publish.yml). The release also ships a SHASUMS256.txt whose
  # digests match the sha256 values below (independently recomputed with `shasum -a 256` on each
  # downloaded asset, not copied from that file) and GitHub's own per-asset `digest` field
  # (`gh release view <tag> --json assets`), which agree with both. There is no cosign/sigstore
  # signature yet — the repo's publish.yml itself notes "cosign still deferred" — so sha256 pinning
  # here is the only integrity check available; revisit this comment if that changes.
